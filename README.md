# Data Analysis Project

In this project, an OACI-provided dataset containing information on aircraft accidents and a World Bank dataset with information on annual 
passenger counts will be analyzed. With the relevant data and acquired conclusions, a Power BI dashboard will be created to visually 
represent this information. Additionally, four key performance indicators (KPIs) will be calculated to evaluate the progress in global air 
safety.

#### Datasets that will be used: https://github.com/Arevalojj2020/PI_02/tree/main/Datasets

The workflow consists of: 
- ETL perform and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (https://github.com/Arevalojj2020/PI_02/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
    + Clean and prepare the data. 
    + Gather information and draw conclusions from the available attributes. 
    + Combine both provided datasets to reach more accurate conclusions.
- Power BI Dashboard (https://github.com/Arevalojj2020/PI_02/blob/main/Dashboard.pbix)
    + Visualize the patterns, trends, and contributing factors found in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Power BI tools. 
    + Calculate 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) and evaluate the progress of global air safety from different perspectives.
